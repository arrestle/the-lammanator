**MISSION:** Operation Bale-Out
**ENCRYPTION KEY:** 🥬🔐🐪

**AGENT’S REPORT:**

Ladies and gentleherds,

This is Agent Lammanator, reporting live from deep undercover inside an artisanal smoothie café in Luxembourg, disguised as a barista-slash-astrologer. Yes, I did tell one suspicious customer that Mercury was in oat milk.

Now, onto the hay-hem.

I have uncovered irrefutable proof that our arch-nemesis, **The Bale Reaper**, leader of the shadowy syndicate known as **C.L.A.W. (Clover Liberation and Alfalfa Withholding)**, has been **stockpiling the world's supply of alfalfa** in a top-secret underground bunker disguised as a yoga retreat for goats.

This operation, codenamed **Project Chewtopia**, aims to:

* Drive up alfalfa prices,
* Spark global unrest among herbivores,
* And corner the market on premium hay for black-market smoothies and illicit bunny spas.

I repeat: **this is not a drill** — it is a pitchfork-level emergency.

---

**NEXT STEPS:**

* I’ve sent in a drone disguised as a dragonfly carrying a USB drive made of kale.
* Waiting on visual confirmation from our double agent: Codename *Nibble*, a disgruntled guinea pig with nothing left to lose.

Should I be compromised, release the emergency broadcast: **“The fields are dry, and the llamas are thirsty.”**

Lammanator out. 🦙💼
*P.S. Requesting backup and oat cookies. The gluten-free ones this time. Not like last time.*
